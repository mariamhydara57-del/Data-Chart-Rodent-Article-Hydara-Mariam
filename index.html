			The average new yorker has seen a rat sighted somewhere whether in a subway station, running near their feet, or even in their apartment. It is something many residents are uncomfortable with. 311 is a resource that residents can use to make complaints of any kind, including rodent sightings. From January 1, 2024 until October 13 of this year, there have been close to 1.7 million calls made for rodent or rat sightings specifically in a family apt or dwelling, according to <a target="_blank" href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9/explore/query/SELECT%20count%28%60community_board%60%29%2C%20%60complaint_type%60%2C%20%60location_type%60%0AWHERE%0A%20%20caseless_contains%28%60complaint_type%60%2C%20%22rodent%22%29%0A%20%20AND%20%60created_date%60%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20BETWEEN%20%222024-01-01T00%3A00%3A00%22%20%3A%3A%20floating_timestamp%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20AND%20%222025-10-16T20%3A48%3A19%22%20%3A%3A%20floating_timestamp%0A%20%20AND%20caseless_contains%28%60location_type%60%2C%20%22family%22%29%0AGROUP%20BY%20%60complaint_type%60%2C%20%60location_type%60/page/aggregate">NYC Open Data.</a>
		</p>

		<p>
			New York City is split up into 59 community boards (CB) - geographically serving as local representative bodies. The breakdown of which community boards have made the most rodent sighting calls are dispersed. The median amount of calls by single CB within the 15-year period sits at 589 (Brooklyn CB 12: Borough Park, Kensington, Midwood, Ocean Park), but the lowest amount of calls with said period of time sits at one (The Bronx CB 28: Pelham Bay Park), with the highest sitting at 3938 (Manhattan Board 11 - East Harlem).

			<h2>The "Dirtiest" Borough</h2>
			<p>
				In local conversation, The Bronx is commonly seen as the “dirtiest” borough. On a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NYStateOfMind/comments/v8h6u5/why_bronx_niggas_act_like_they_aint_the_dirtiest/">reddit post </a> from 2022, some of the comments emphasize this point. User @Aromatic_Ad6178 states that “everyone used to call the Bronx mad dirty” and @jamesjebbianyc posts “The Bronx is dirty and ghetto, but there’s a lot of soul here unlike Brooklyn.” But according to the 311 data, Manhattan and Brooklyn share the top 10 community board spots. 
 
			</p>

			<p>
				Despite that, the Bronx is the borough whose complaints come in the highest amounts from the same household. Out of the top five apartments that have called the most in approximately the last 2 years, one resides in Manhattan Community Board 11 while the remaining four resides in The Bronx, ranging from 64 to 3,159 calls per household. Alternatively, other boards and boroughs have a higher amount of complaints from varying households.

			<h2>A New Response to Sanitation: <div> Introduction of M9 Containerization Pilot </div> </h2>

</div>
			<p>
				Community Board Manhattan 9 identified this issue of trash storage, often the root of rodent sightings, and introduced the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/dsny/collection/containerization/m9-bins.page#empire-bins">M9 Containerization Pilot</a> on June 1st, 2025 as a result. This initiative is in an effort to containerize all of the neighborhood’s trash in “Empire Bins,” which are large, stationary, on-street containers that are locked and can hold approximately four cubic yards of waste. From that pilot date until mid October 2025 there have been 227 complaints made. In comparison, last year during the same block of time, from June 1, 2024 through October 13, 2024, there were 452 complaints made, halfing the amount of 311 complaints post-pilot.

			<h2>Impact of 311 Calls Data</h2>
			<p>
				With that being said, Jonathan Auerbach explains that the volume of 311 calls don’t precisely directly point to an influx of rat populations. Auerbach is an assistant professor in the department of statistics at George Mason University. Auerbach has also done studies diving into the relevance of the 311 calls and the conclusions that can be made from them. 
			</p>

			<p>
				“It is not so easy to determine the rat population from the volume of calls to 311… A 10% increase in rat sightings does not necessarily mean a 10% increase in rats. If the rat population increases by one rat, then that rat may have multiple interactions with humans and thus there are many more opportunities for rat sightings,” Auerbach states.  
			</p>

			<p>
				The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/rats.page">Department of Health</a> publicized advice for dealing with rodents is to clean up, clear visible garble, keep areas free of tall weeds, trim shrubs, check for cracks, and not litter. 
			</p>

			<p>
			Rodents continue to be a problem and according to Auerbach, “Rodents are an infrastructure problem.” Food and trash lures rats and “require a combination of personal responsibility [and] law enforcement. Right now, law enforcement is piecemeal so that the rat population quickly rebounds after any action. Also, a lot of pest management strategies feel good but have no scientific basis for sustaining a lasting population reduction,” Auerbach stated.
